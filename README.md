# docs_dangit: A search engine for WordPress developers

Website: https://docs-dang.it/

[CloudFest 2023 Hackathon project](https://www.cloudfest.com/a-search-engine-for-wordpress-developers)

This repo contains the frontend code for [the project website](https://docs-dang.it/). Code for the backend is in [docs_dangit-the-beast](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast) repo.

## Sources

Sources are listed below in the order they have been added to the project.

### WordPress code reference

The Code reference handbook is partly generated from the code. Most of the code samples are in the User Contributed Notes section, which are comments ([example](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#user-contributed-notes)). 

URL: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/

### WP-CLI 

We use [`wp cli cmd-dump`](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/blob/main/php/commands/src/CLI_Command.php#L543) to export all commands in a giant JSON file which is stored in the GitHub repo. [GitHub action](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-wp-cli-commands.yml) is doing this automatically once a day at 6AM.

URL: https://github.com/wp-cli/handbook/tree/main/commands 

### PHP code reference

Official PHP documentation, hosted on https://github.com/php/doc-en.

URL: https://www.php.net/docs.php

### WordPress dev notes

Every WordPress release is accomanied with a number of dev notes in Core blog. These notes are packed with useful code examples.

## Technical solution

### Backend

Parsers are built on top of [Symfony Console](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html) component. At the moment of building the tool (CloudFest hackathon 2023), there are two parsers:
- [WordPress code reference](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast/blob/main/src/Parsers/WordPress_Docs.php) 
- [WP-CLI](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast/blob/main/src/Parsers/WP_CLI.php)
- [PHP code reference](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast/blob/main/src/Parsers/PHP_Docs.php)
- [WordPress dev notes](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast/blob/main/src/Parsers/Make_WordPress.php)

Storage is in mySQL with a full-text index and [a small API](https://github.com/zzap/docs_dangit-the-beast/tree/main/backend) built with [Laminas](https://docs.laminas.dev/) and [Mezzio](https://docs.mezzio.dev/) frameworks. API is private for now but could be made public in the future given the proper setup and storage financing is provided.

#### Data fields

- Code snippet - the snippet extracted from the source.
- Context - the whole data chunk, e.g. comment
- Parse date - the date source was parsed.
- URL - URL of the source.
- Code creator - author of the snippet (if available).
- Code creation datetime - the date of source creation (if available), e.g. comment date.
- Source - the source of the snippet, e.g. wpcli, wp-reference, wp-reference-comment etc. 
- Version - source version, e.g. WP 6.2, WP-CLI 2.7 etc.
- Command tags - the command/function found in the snippet, e.g. update_term_meta.
- Tags - general taxonomy based on various criteria, e.g. WordPress (based on CMS), Laravel (based on the framework) etc. 
- Language - [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) of the source, e.g. en-US.
- Codelang tags - Tag for the code language, e.g. PHP, JavaScript etc.

#### Before starting

Create the Key and Cert for a Certification authority by calling the following commands on the CLI:

```bash
cd /path/to/backend/.docker/nginx/
openssl genrsa -out ssl/ca.key 4096;
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -subj "/C=de/O=docs/CN=development certificates;" -key ssl/ca.key -sha512 -days 3650 -out ssl/ca.crt;
```

This will create the necessary files. You should import the CRT file as certification authority into your browser to not
get remarks that the website might be insecure.

#### Usage

With a working docker-setup you can start the development environment via `docker compose up -d`.

This should download and create all the necessary information to get up and running.

You should also add the line `127.17.0.1 docs.dangit` to your `/etc/hosts` file to be able to resolve the docs.dangit
development website

Then you can point your browser to `https://docs.dangit` and enjoy

### Frontend
Frontend is built on [React.js](https://react.dev/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
